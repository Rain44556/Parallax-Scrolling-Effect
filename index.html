                    untainted wilderness, and tranquil beauty. One can be made to feel small and insignificant in
                    comparison by the soaring mountains and boundless sky above, underscoring the vastness of nature.
                    However, it can also be a very inspiring and liberating experience. An intense sense of peace and a
                    connection to the sky and earth can be found in the solitude and the sensation of being encircled by
                    unspoiled, beautiful scenery. It's an occasion to pause, think, and be in awe of the strength and
                    beauty of nature.</div>
